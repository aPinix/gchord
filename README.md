# GChord (Generate Chord)

Welcome 👋

Made with ❤️&nbsp;&nbsp;by **André Pinto** ([@aPinix](https://twitter.com/aPinix)) from Portugal.

This is a small project that was made because I, as a guitarrist, wanted a practical way to produce those cool little tablature images so I coul put them into a LYRICS document as a **cheat sheet**.

<br>

**FEATURES:**

- Can produce tablature
- Can change tuning
- Can do open and closed notes
- Can save as image to your device

<br>

**TODO:**

- Bass support (and maybe other string intruments as well)

<br>

It can help you too! Knock yourself out 😀
